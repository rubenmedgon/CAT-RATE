## Introduction

**Kit-Rate** is an exciting game of strategy and fun that takes the classic concept of "rock, paper, scissors" to a new level. However, instead of the classic options, players use *Fire, Water, and Plant*  to compete. Immerse yourself in a world where two adorable cats face off in an epic duel of natural elements.

## User Manual

The game is visually appealing and designed to keep players entertained with its dynamic gameplay and charming graphics. Players challenge each other using three fundamental elements:

ðŸ”¥ Fire
ðŸ’§ Water
ðŸŒ¿ Plant

The rules of combat are simple but strategic:
- Fire melts Plant
- Plant absorbs Water
- Water extinguishes Fire

### How To Play

1. **Kick-off:** At the beginning, players will see their cards on the screen.

2. **Each player's turn:**
    - Player 1 selects a card by clicking on it.
    - Player 2 selects his card afterward.

3. **Victory evaluation:** Once the cards have been selected, the game evaluates the winner of the round according to the victory conditions:

    - Victory by domain: A player collects three cards of the same category (e.g., three Fire cards).
    - Victory by equilibrium: A player collects one card of each category (Fire, Water, and Plant).

4. **Track progress:** The game updates scores and displays the current status.
